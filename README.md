# Vibe coding outputs for SAML singl sign-on

These are some outputs from Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, from a test of how good each application is at vibe coding a full web app with SAML single sign-on.

## The prompt

"I want to add SAML single sign-on as an authentication option for my Next.js web app. As the end user of the app, I would expect a "single sign-on" button to appear next to the login/password option of the sign-in screen. Assume that any SAML configuration is done via environment variables or a static config file. The code must be safe and secure. Please generate the full code required for this - including any back end code needed. Assume the app is single-tenant and only needs to support one SAML provider."
